# SuperNovo

SuperNovo is a utility for identifying and validating De Novo Mutations in Next Generation Sequencing data. It's current functionality is to generate a file of metrics for De Novo SNPs and Indels from a VCF/BCF of variants and SAM/BAM/CRAMs for a child and parents. In the future, it will be able to operate without the VCF/BCF of variants and perform de novo variant calling.

This project is very much still in progress and should be considered an alpha release.
